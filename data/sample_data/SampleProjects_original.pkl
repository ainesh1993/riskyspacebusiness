915,1196,"Test as You Fly, Fly as You Test, and Demonstrate Margin (1998)","Mars Polar Lander had deficiencies in compliance with the principle of “test-as-you-fly,” which requires that ground tests and simulations accurately reflect the planned mission profile, plus margin. Enforce the system-level test principle of “test as you fly, and fly as you test,” and carefully assess any planned violations. When using simulations for system-level verification, validate models and include sufficient parametric variations in the simulations to ensure that adequate margins exist.","The process of end-to-end system verification (either through testing, simulation, or analysis) may be compromised when it is not consistent with the mission profile (plus margin and the appropriate off-design parameters).","Enforce the system-level test principle of ""test as you fly, and fly as you test."" Carefully assess any planned violations of this principle; if they are necessary, take alternate measures such as independent validation. Departures from this principle must be reflected in the project risk management plan, communicated to senior management for concurrence, and reported at reviews. When using simulations for system-level verification, models must have been validated (e.g., supported by test); and sufficient parametric variations in the simulations must be performed to ensure that adequate margins exist.",JPL,01/24/2002,"The principle of ""test-as-you-fly"" means that ground tests and simulations should accurately reflect the planned mission profile, plus margin and the appropriate off-design parameters. Although the system level test and verification process for Mars Polar Lander (MPL) was well planned and executed, there were deficiencies in the test program for the parachute, terminal descent, and touchdown phases. MPL test deficiencies included: The touchdown sensing software was not tested with the lander in the flight configuration, leading to the probable cause of the MPL mission loss. (See Lesson #0938) Fault-injection testing of the flight software was not thorough enough to detect all logic errors in post-landing fault-response algorithms. (See Lesson #0939.) The thermal design of the propulsion subsystem was incorrectly characterized in system thermal-vacuum test due to an error in the thermal model, causing major errors in the propulsion thermal design that went undetected until after launch. The test and verification process for the Deep Space 2 (DS2) probe, which was co-launched with MPL and did not survive Mars Encounter, also departed from the test-as-you-fly principle in end-to-end testing and analysis: A decision was made to not conduct a system-level impact test of the probe with aeroshell. The risk of structural failure from the dynamic interaction between the aeroshell and the probe was recognized and accepted. Though DS2 was designed to strike the Martian surface at a velocity of 200 meters per second, there was no impact test of an electrically powered, complete system. The flight battery lot was not subjected to impact tests. Testing performed on an 8-cell predecessor flight-like lot did not provide statistical confidence as it resulted in one structural failure. Adequate system margins were not demonstrated during the MPL terminal descent control system testing. These margins were subject to erosion from propulsion system dynamics (impulse variations due to water hammer or thermal effects), propellant center-of-mass migration, the lack of a high-fidelity fuel slosh model, and nonlinear pulse-width modulation effects. The true margins of the system were not fully characterized in the presence of these effects.

1434,654,Assessment and Control of Electrical Charges,,"Impact of Nonpractice: Adverse effects of electrostatic charges on space vehicle design, development, test and operation sometimes have been serious. Such effects include inadvertent ignition of electroexplosive devices, spurious triggering of electronics, and damage to insulating materials. The ignition, by electrostatic discharge, of the final stage solid rocket motor of the Delta launch vehicle for the Orbiting Solar Observatory spacecraft during test operations killed three men in 1964. Electrostatic discharges previously had ignited a similar motor without loss of life. In addition, failures of several vehicles after launch have been attributed to electrostatic discharges. Electrostatic discharges in the atmosphere can have adverse effects on launch operation. NASA SP-8084, revision of June 1974, gives models that should be applied to electrostatic problems. The lightning strikes on Apollo 12, shortly after liftoff, caused major disturbances to on-board electrical systems. Fortunately, most of the effects in this case were of a temporary nature and the mission was able to continue. To be effective, a program to minimize the hazards of the electrostatic discharges must be instituted early in the design phase and must consider all aspects of the design, test, launch, and operations of the launch vehicle, spacecraft, and experiments.","Practice: Provide protection against electrostatic charges, discharges, and lightning strikes by shielding and bonding space systems, structures, and their components in accordance with Standard Payload Assurance Requirements (SPAR-3) for GSFC Orbital Projects. This reliability practice does not cover Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) control due to an energetic space plasma environment.",GSFC,02/01/1999,"This Lessons Learned is based on Reliability Practice No. PD-ED-1210; from NASA Technical Memorandum 4322A, NASA Reliability Preferred Practices for Design and Test. Benefit: The Earth's space environment (geospace) is uniquely comprised of dynamic and complex regions of interacting plasmas, ionized particles, magnetic fields and electrical currents. Proper grounding/bonding of the space vehicle's shell and its electronic equipment can provide protection against lightning strikes in geospace, and also can eliminate or control most of its internal electrical and electrostatic hazards. This results in lower failure rates and significant reliability and safety enhancement of space systems and space vehicles. Implementation Method: For space vehicles all sections of the vehicle's outer shell should be bonded together to permit large quantities of electric charge to distribute across the shell by conducting paths. The bonded shell of the space vehicle then acts as an electrical shield to protect internal structures from lightning and atmospheric electricity. Ground wires should be used for individual systems when appropriate. Wires should be adequate to carry a surge without mechanical damage. NASA has established lightning protection requirements for design, and procedures to demonstrate that these requirements are implemented for the Space Shuttle program in NASA document NSTS 07636, which is a subtier to NSTS 07700, Volume X. NSTS 07636 defines the conducted current lightning environment for design, and imposes the requirements that the design must satisfy to ensure the protection of the Space Shuttle from the direct and indirect effects of lightning. A practical approach to lightning protection problems is presented in the appendices of NSTS 07636, which are: Appendix A, ""Conducted Current Lightning Environment""; Appendix B, ""Lightning Strike Zones""; Appendix C, ""Test Waveforms and Methods""; Appendix D, ""Methods for Estimating the Internal Induced Voltage and Current Environment""; Appendix E, ""Analysis Methodology"", and Appendix F, ""Lightning Bonds"". Bonding and grounding requirements are defined in MIL-B-5087B(ASG), ""Bonding, Electrical, and Lightning Protection for Aerospace Systems"". Table 1 provides typical classifications for electrical bonds from that document. TABLE 1. Electrical Bond Classes of Application1 CLASS APPLICATION MIL-B-5087B(ASG) REFERENCE PARAGRAPH A Antenna installation 3.3.1 C Current path return 3.3.2 H Shock hazard 3.3.3 L Lightning protection 3.3.4 R Rf potentials 3.3.5 S Static charge 3.3.6 1Where a single bond is used to serve two or more classes of application, the design shall conform to the most critical requirement of bonding. Class L bonding requirements are designed to achieve protection against lightning discharge current carried between the extremities of an airborne vehicle without risk of damaging flight controls or producing sparking or voltages within the vehicle in excess of 500 volts. These requirements are based upon a lightning current waveform of 200,000 amperes peak, a width of 5 to 10 microseconds at the 90% point, not less than 20 microseconds width at the 50% point, and a rate of at least 100,000 amperes per microsecond. Test requirements are described in MIL-STD-1757A, ""Lightning Qualification Test Techniques for Aerospace Vehicles and Hardware"" (The term ""aerospace vehicles"" includes fixed/variable wing aircraft, helicopters, missles, and spacecraft.) This document presents a set of standard test waveforms and techniques for lightning qualification testing of aerospace vehicles and hardware. The test waveforms presented in this document are intended to reproduce the significant effects of the natural environment and are therefore independent of vehicle type or configuration. The tests include high voltage and high current physical damage tests of fuel, structural and electrical hardware, as well as indirect effects associated with lightning strikes to externally mounted electrical hardware. The capability to test hardware and design concepts in a lightning environment has been very limited in the past. However, there are presently test facilities that are able to generate and simulate the levels of voltage, current and charge transfers typical of lightning phenomena. Therefore full scale, full threat lightning tests that meet the requirements of MIL-STD-1757A and NSTS 07636 are now available. Technical Rationale: LIGHTNING ENVIRONMENT. The currents in a lightning flash are conveniently separated into three categories: Return stroke surges with peak currents of up to 200,000 amps or more and with durations on the order of tens of microseconds. Intermediate currents of up to 10,000 amps or more and with durations on the order of milliseconds. Continuing currents of up to 1000 amps and with durations on the order of hundreds of milliseconds. Intermediate and continuing currents are primarily responsible for damage such as hole-burning while return stroke currents mainly produce explosive effects and indirect effects. There are also currents associated with subsequent return strokes and there are phases of return strokes characterized by rapid rates of change. These categories are represented by idealized waveforms designated A,B,C,D, and H. These waveforms and their mathematical definitions are described in Appendix A of NSTS 07636E. The accumulation of electrostatic charges on the electrically isolated bodies could lead to a number of results that might affect the success of a space mission. Breakdown occurs when the electric field exceeds the dielectric strength of the medium. Charge then crosses the dielectric between oppositely-charged bodies. Heat and electromagnetic energy are emitted with the passage of the charge. Besides the electric field strength imposed on the medium, the occurrence and severity of the discharge depend on system geometry and secondary discharge effects. The gaseous medium that surrounds the components of a space vehicle is particularly vulnerable to breakdown in altitudes around 30 km. The dielectric strength of the atmosphere passes through a minimum at the reduced pressures associated with those altitudes. The various field strengths that might be present on the space vehicle can cause atmospheric breakdown. Breakdown could still be possible at much higher altitudes or even in orbit because of residual gases and outgassing materials in the space vehicle that could increase the localized gas pressure until it reached the breakdown region. Air launched spacecraft such as Pegasus must minimize tribo-electric charging even during fair weather. This is done by conductive surfaces and/or discharge wicks. This is of particular concern when composite fairings are used. Breakdown of the gaseous medium occurs when the electric fields on the vehicle are strong enough to break apart the atoms or molecules of the medium into ions and electrons that then move according to the voltage gradient. If recombination takes place before the ions or electrons impinge on their respective electrodes, the breakdown is considered a partial one and is designated corona. If the gaseous ions impinge on both electrodes, then breakdown of the dielectric between them is complete and is referred to as arcing or an arc discharge.

419,2045,Failure of Pyrotechnic Operated Valves with Dual Initiators,"Four spacecraft propulsion system pyrovalve no-fire failures were investigated by the NESC (NASA Engineering and Safety Center). In all four cases, a normally closed pyrovalve failed to actuate during tests in which simultaneous firing of dual initiators failed to ignite the booster charge. Timing of redundant initiator firings is crucial for reliable operation of pyrovalves. Dual simultaneous firing (< 10 microseconds skew) is not as robust as a single firing and should be avoided.","The CONAX PCA design has evolved slowly over time undergoing incremental changes to correct known issues. These piecewise changes were verified by limited test, without a full understanding of the overall system impact or effect on margins. Adequate system performance margins may be adversely affected in existing or future systems incorporating a pyrovalve actuated by simultaneous firing of dual initiators. The primary finding from this investigation is that dual simultaneous firing (< 10 microseconds skew) is not as robust as a single firing and should be avoided.","When close sequential firing of the redundant initiator is necessary, the NESC recommends the skew time between initiator firings should ideally be longer than the flow duration for single fire. Thus the NESC recommendation that use of the device should be constrained to single fire operation (or dual with skew greater than 2 milliseconds) to ensure robustness of booster ignition. The NESC has forwarded this finding, and others related to critical PCA parameters and device qualification issues, to projects using the current design. In addition, the NESC contributed to a new stainless steel PCA design activity initiated by the Mars Science Laboratory project.",NESC,05/10/2009,"Four spacecraft propulsion system pyrovalve quotno-firequot failures were investigated by the NESC (NASA Engineering and Safety Center). In all four cases, a normally closed pyrovalve failed to actuate during tests in which simultaneous firing of dual initiators failed to ignite the booster charge. In each failure, a common aluminum Y-shaped PCA (Y-PCA) manufactured by CONAX was used to mechanically accommodate the two initiators and to direct the individual output products of each initiator towards the booster charge. Booster charge ignition is intended to generate sufficient pressure to actuate the pyrovalve. Testing of both single and dual initiators revealed important design characteristics affecting pyrovalve device performance. They include Primer Chamber Assembly (PCA) geometry and material properties, as well as operational effects on combustion product flow, and resulting energy transfer to the booster.",,,,,Public,Not Specified,"CONAX Y-PCA Booster Anomaly Investigation Report<br/>

571,1557,"Management Reviews, Reporting and Technical Publications","A. Reviews: General feedback received from all levels of project participants - There are too many reviews without clear definition of their purpose. As a result, reviews tended to overlap in their charters and often provided conflicting recommendations. Those involved in projects would be more motivated to support reviews if they could see and experience distinct, valuable purposes that each review served. Independent review committees are not allowed (or do not take) adequate review time to understand the project»s work, accomplishments, etc. and alignment with schedule and budget. As a result, many of the findings are incorrect or misleading as a result of misunderstandings or lack of knowledge about the project. B. Reporting: General feedback received - Too much disconnected upward reporting with little downward direction where the Program and/or Headquarters express direct interest or understanding in the work of the project and helping to make it successful. AATT spent a lot of time and resources dealing with high-level issues throughout the life of the project. C. Technical Publications: The AATT Project Office made a special point to request and remind technical and sub-project managers that project recognition be appropriately documented in technical publications. This was a recurring problem throughout the 9-year life of the project.","Too many reviews and reports that often times are repetitive and redundant providing the same information in different formats to different managers and teams, is costly in terms of time, resources and morale. Every minute taken to put together and prepare huge packages of information that does not seem to be read and/or understood, takes away from a manager»s time and resources to assure the work of the project is successfully accomplished.","A. It is recommended that there be fewer independent reviews, each with more time allotted to the project under review. There should be adequate time provided for discussion of the draft findings with the project manager, for a feedback loop that may lead to the committee modifying or refining its findings. Related to the above is up-front accurate communication to the projects exactly what the reviewer»s want covered in terms of content. Too often AATT Project personnel were trying to determine what the reviewers wanted to see and hear. A reasonable and practical amount of format/content standardization would be helpful in preventing waste of time and having to scramble to get what the review committee decides it really wants to see on site during the review itself. B. The obvious ideal reporting scenario is one that minimizes duplicative, redundant and multiple ways of providing the same information. A single Agency-wide reporting/information system should be developed and carefully thought out with the input of those having to provide the information. Project managers should only have to deal with this kind of thing once a month (at most) and it should suffice for all organizations and levels of management including Program Management Councils. The only thing that might be different is the level of detail, but in no case should detailed project level information be required that is not really necessary for upper level managers to have. This becomes “micro management” at its worst and can result in inefficient waste of scarce resources and time. PMs usually end up spending valuable time away from managing their projects in order to answer questions and explain to those not knowledgeable or involved in the specific needs and day-to-day operations of the project»s work. C. The AATT Project recommends that project recognition in publications be brought up and made a written policy to all involved individuals and managers from the very beginning. The appropriate standards, including place and format should be discussed and agreed to as part of this policy arrangement. The AATT Project also recommends that future projects have a common process and format for technical documents to ensure easy retrieval from a database.

The standard nozzles in these rockets were replaced by the aerospike nozzles and the rockets are then flown with aerospike nozzles only. Two aerospike rockets were flown successfully to altitudes of over 26,000 ft and speeds of over Mach 1.5. The flight data acquired during the flight tests were stored onboard and retrieved after the rockets were recovered. The rocket chamber pressure was one of the mission-critical onboard measurements. During the first rocket launch, hot rocket exhaust gas was allowed to impinge directly inside the rocket chamber pressure transducer sensing port. Even though the pressure transducer was designed to survive hostile environments and remained operational, the high gas temperature caused it to produce pressure readings that were erroneously high for the firt two seconds of rocket motor firing.
