1196,"Test as You Fly, Fly as You Test, and Demonstrate Margin (1998)","Mars Polar Lander had deficiencies in compliance with the principle of “test-as-you-fly,” which requires that ground tests and simulations accurately reflect the planned mission profile, plus margin. Enforce the system-level test principle of “test as you fly, and fly as you test,” and carefully assess any planned violations. When using simulations for system-level verification, validate models and include sufficient parametric variations in the simulations to ensure that adequate margins exist.",2,Operational Cost Risk,0.8502751268477601,0.04722996585706909,0.10249490729517084,0.8502751268477601

2045,Failure of Pyrotechnic Operated Valves with Dual Initiators,"Four spacecraft propulsion system pyrovalve no-fire failures were investigated by the NESC (NASA Engineering and Safety Center). In all four cases, a normally closed pyrovalve failed to actuate during tests in which simultaneous firing of dual initiators failed to ignite the booster charge. Timing of redundant initiator firings is crucial for reliable operation of pyrovalves. Dual simultaneous firing (< 10 microseconds skew) is not as robust as a single firing and should be avoided.",2,Operational Cost Risk,0.739754774319939,0.19350941384325124,0.0667358118368098,0.739754774319939

262,Concurrent Real-Time Operations and Advanced Planning,"The magnitude of both the real-time cruise activities and the work required to perform advanced planning for future activities, such as encounter, landing site certification, test and training, and orbit insertion activities during the Viking mission were significantly underestimated and required an unplanned organizational change during the cruise operations. When spacecraft mission encounter and post-encounter planning are not completed prior to launch, separate organizations should be established for conducting the cruise activities and accomplishing the encounter planning.",2,Operational Cost Risk,0.843076869906963,0.015530525607795734,0.14139260448524135,0.843076869906963
1557,"Management Reviews, Reporting and Technical Publications","A. Reviews: General feedback received from all levels of project participants - There are too many reviews without clear definition of their purpose. As a result, reviews tended to overlap in their charters and often provided conflicting recommendations. Those involved in projects would be more motivated to support reviews if they could see and experience distinct, valuable purposes that each review served. Independent review committees are not allowed (or do not take) adequate review time to understand the project»s work, accomplishments, etc. and alignment with schedule and budget. As a result, many of the findings are incorrect or misleading as a result of misunderstandings or lack of knowledge about the project. B. Reporting: General feedback received - Too much disconnected upward reporting with little downward direction where the Program and/or Headquarters express direct interest or understanding in the work of the project and helping to make it successful. AATT spent a lot of time and resources dealing with high-level issues throughout the life of the project. C. Technical Publications: The AATT Project Office made a special point to request and remind technical and sub-project managers that project recognition be appropriately documented in technical publications. This was a recurring problem throughout the 9-year life of the project.",1,Managerial Process Risk,0.9820986923768981,0.0036464623905802,0.9820986923768981,0.014254845232521669
430,"Permeability, Swelling and Solvent-Stress-Cracking Polymeric and Elastomeric Materials (1977)","During fabrication of the TIROS-N Microwave Sounding Unit, connector cleaning fluids penetrated to the interior of the chassis. This caused severe swelling of the conformal coating material and the subsequent fracture of electronic components, dissolution of polyurethane insulation on the magnet hookup wire, and removal of component identification markings. To preclude detrimental results, care should be exercised in the selection of fluids to be used with or in the presence of polymeric and elastomeric materials.",0,Technical Execution Risk,0.9508895649442758,0.9508895649442758,0.006194339445288845,0.04291609561043543
1621,Protection of Rocket Chamber Pressure Transducer Sensing Port,"The Dryden Aerospike Rocket Test Director's Discretionary Fund (DDF) project conducted flight research of an aerospike rocket nozzle design using high power amateur rockets. The standard nozzles in these rockets were replaced by the aerospike nozzles and the rockets are then flown with aerospike nozzles only. Two aerospike rockets were flown successfully to altitudes of over 26,000 ft and speeds of over Mach 1.5. The flight data acquired during the flight tests were stored onboard and retrieved after the rockets were recovered. The rocket chamber pressure was one of the mission-critical onboard measurements. During the first rocket launch, hot rocket exhaust gas was allowed to impinge directly inside the rocket chamber pressure transducer sensing port. Even though the pressure transducer was designed to survive hostile environments and remained operational, the high gas temperature caused it to produce pressure readings that were erroneously high for the firt two seconds of rocket motor firing. During the second launch, silicon vacuum grease was used to pack the pressure port. This shielded the pressure sensing port from the hot gas impingement, and good rocket chamber pressure measurements were obtained.",0,Technical Execution Risk,0.8348370204687612,0.8348370204687612,0.054780690614834725,0.11038228891640411
