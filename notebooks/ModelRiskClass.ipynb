    "# Topic Modeling with LDA to Generate Target Risk Topics\n",
    "Author: Ainesh Pandey\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will perform topic modeling using [LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)](https://towardsdatascience.com/latent-dirichlet-allocation-lda-9d1cd064ffa2) on the _Lesson(s) Learned_ column of the `lessons_learned.csv` dataframe. The purpose of this analysis is to attempt to organize the different projects into risk topics. Assuming the LDA model produces reasonable topics, we can use the topic classification as ground truth in a modeling objective.\n",
